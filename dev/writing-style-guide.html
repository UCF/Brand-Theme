<dl class="inline">
<dt>A&amp;P</dt>
<dd>Administrative and Professional employment classification. Acceptable on first reference for stories on campus but spell out the name in the story.</dd>

<dt>abbreviations and acronyms</dt>
<dd>Avoid turning stories into alphabet soup. Universities have many buildings, courses, organizations, clubs, programs and titles that often are shortened for casual use, but generally spell them on first reference. It is not necessary to follow a full name with an abbreviation in parentheses; if an abbreviation on second reference is not clear on its own, don’t use it. It is often more clear on second reference to say <em>the department</em> or <em>the organization</em> or use some other identifier rather than use unfamiliar abbreviations and acronyms. Some abbreviations, however, have become so universally known that they stand alone, such as NCAA, SAT, GPA, ROTC and others, that can be used on first reference.</dd>

<dt>academic degrees </dt>
<dd>The preferred form is to use <em>bachelor’s degree</em> and <em>master’s degree</em> in place of abbreviations. Also acceptable without a possessive in this style: <em>Bachelor of Arts</em> and <em>Master of Science</em>.</dd>

<dt>Abbreviations</dt>
<dd>can be used when the use of full terms would be cumbersome, as in a list of people. To abbreviate, use periods and no spaces between letters, such as <em>B.S.</em> (Bachelor of Science) or <em>M.A.</em> (Master of Arts). For degrees with three or more capital letters, such as MBA or MFA, omit the periods. The word <em>degree</em> does not follow a degree abbreviation.</dd>

<dt>An <em>Associate of Arts</em></dt>
<dd>is a two-year post-secondary degree offered by colleges. For students who transfer to UCF, the degree serves as the first two years of work for a bachelor’s degree. <em>Associate degree</em> is not possessive.</dd>

<dt>See Ph.D.</dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>academic departments </dt>
<dd>Capitalize as part of an official name as in <em>Department of Political Science </em>and <em>Department of History,</em> but lowercase when referring to them generically as in the <em>political science department</em> or <em>history department</em>.</dd>

<dt>academic titles</dt>
<dd>Capitalize and spell formal titles (president, provost, dean, chancellor, vice president) when they precede a name: <em>Dean Abe Pizam</em>. Lowercase titles elsewhere, such as: <em>Abe Pizam, dean</em>. When used as descriptors, lowercase titles when they identify something else: <em>dean’s list, provost’s office</em>. Do not abbreviate <em>assistant</em> or <em>associate</em>.</dd>

<dt>See professor.</dt>
<dd></dd>

<dt>accents</dt>
<dd>Use tildes and other accent marks when spelling proper names and other words as needed. Depress <em>control</em> and <em>apostrophe</em> keys while typing the vowels for <em>á, é, í, ó</em> and <em>ú</em>.
For <em>ñ</em>, depress the Alt key and type numbers 164 on the right side of the keyboard.
For <em>ü</em>, type Alt 0252.
