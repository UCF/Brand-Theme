    <h2>What is Brand?</h2>
    There are so many competing definitions for the word brand—from the <strong>graphics and symbols</strong> to the <strong>“promise”</strong> a company makes. At UCF, we simply say:
    &nbsp;
    <span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:42px;line-height:50px;">Brand is everything we say and do, and how we say and do it.</span>

        UCF has evolved into the nation’s second-largest university by implementing innovative growth strategies wrapped around a simple principle: listening to and responding to the region’s needs.

        <blockquote>
        We are more than higher education.
        We are a whole new category.
        We innovate.
        We incubate.
        We develop skilled labor.
        We assist businesses.
        We improve lives.
        We save lives.</blockquote>
        &nbsp;
        <h4>UCF is in the business of creating opportunities.</h4>
        More formally, our core concept can be summed up in UCF’s Brand Value Proposition:

        <blockquote>
        UCF is the university that seeks opportunities, creates opportunities, and brings them to fruition. The university’s culture of opportunity is driven by the diverse people it attracts, its Orlando environment, its history of entrepreneurship, and its youth, relevance, and energy.
        </blockquote>

        The six core concepts should inform all UCF communication materials, though obviously not every concept can or need be addressed in every piece.
