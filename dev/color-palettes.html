        <strong>The official colors of UCF—black and gold—are as much a part of our identity as the Pegasus.</strong> Color management is a key component of any successful brand, but precise color management is difficult across varying media. The color gold can be particularly difficult to translate with consistency.
        <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Although black and gold are the university’s official colors, communication products can be designed in any color appropriate for the concept.</li>
            <li>During the design process, be aware that certain color combinations (such as orange and blue) are the official colors of other state universities.</li>
            <li>Any appropriate font can be used in communication products (with the exception of official UCF logos).</li>
            <li>Avoid placing the logo on textured or patterned backgrounds.</li>
            <li>Provide sufficient empty space around and between trademarks and other design elements on a page. The recommended minimum distance is approximately half the width of the trademark. UCF trademarks should appear as distinct units independent from other design elements on a page.</li>
            <li>For proper printing, images should be at least 300 dpi at 100 percent size. Images taken from the web are 72 dpi and are not appropriate for printing.</li>
        </ul>

                        Because the metallic effect cannot be reproduced on uncoated (or “dull”) paper, cannot be matched in effect or hue in process (CMYK) form, and increases printing costs, a nonmetallic alternative is available. This alternate color works best where visibility, contrast and budget are priorities. PMS 7406 is not significantly affected by paper choice, as other options may be, and is also very similar to its process equivalent (100Y 21M). It reproduces well in newsprint and magazines and is highly visible on billboards and the web. PMS 7406 is not appropriate for presidential materials, prestige pieces, letterhead and business cards, or formal announcements. PMS 7406 should only be used in situations appropriate to the content, context, budget and intended use of a piece.

                        Metallic gold has a reflective sheen meant to mimic the look of metal and reproduces most accurately on coated (or “glossy”) paper. Metallic inks are made of varnish, pigments, and metal dust or flakes. An overprint of gloss varnish or aqueous coating is also generally recommended to protect the metal from flaking.
