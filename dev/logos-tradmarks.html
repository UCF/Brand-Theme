    <h3>UCF Trademark Guidelines</h3>
    Who can use UCF trademarks without prior approval from UCF Marketing?
    <ul>
        <li>UCF Board of Trustees; UCF colleges, departments and units; UCF faculty and staff for official university-related business</li>
        <li>UCF Student Government Association (SGA) for official university-related business</li>
        <li>UCF Direct Support Organizations for official university- related business</li>
    </ul>
    All of the above shall hereafter be referred to as <strong>"authorized UCF trademark users."</strong> All others not listed in the section above must secure permission in writing from UCF Marketing prior to using UCF trademarks — this includes but is not limited to students and student clubs and/or student organizations registered through the Office of Student Involvement (OSI).

    <h2>Our Name</h2>
    We are known as <strong>"UCF"</strong> or <strong>"University of Central Florida,"</strong> never just "Central Florida." When stacked, "University of" must be at least 70 percent of the size of "Central Florida." This emphasizes UCF as a university, not a region. It should always appear near or on the same page as the Pegasus logo.

    <h2>Our Logo <small>Pegasus, the Winged Horse of Greek Mythology</small></h2>
</div>

<div>
    <img class="alignleft pull-right size-thumbnail wp-image-436" title="Pegasus-Bright-Gold" src="/files/2011/08/Pegasus-Bright-Gold-150x150.png"
        alt="Gold Pegasus Logo" width="130" height="130" />
    <h3>Our logo is the Pegasus.</h3>
    It is our badge and emblem. It creates, promotes and protects the integrity of the UCF message. It should be used to identify UCF on all communication materials. &nbsp;
    <h4>Where Does the Pegasus Come From?</h4>
    <img class="alignleft pull-right size-full wp-image-322" title="Pegasus" src="/files/2011/08/Pegasus.png" alt="Black Pegasus Logo"
        width="130" height="130" />Pegasus is the winged horse of Greek mythology. He carried heroes on to great adventures and earned a place in the stars as a constellation. The logo was officially unveiled by President Charles Millican on April 5, 1968, from a design by Jim Shattuck and Norman Van Meter. More than 50 proposals were considered during the process. The Pegasus design was chosen for its distinctiveness—and it symbolizes the university’s vision of limitless possibilities. &nbsp;

    <img class="alignleft pull-right size-thumbnail wp-image-350" title="Seal-With-Motto-K-O-T-v10" src="/files/2011/08/Seal-With-Motto-K-O-T-v10-150x150.png"
        alt="UCF Seal, only official use by BOT, General Counsel, President and Provost" width="150" height="150" />
    <h4>Official Seal</h4>
    The seal is used at formal, universitywide academic functions. Use is restricted to the UCF Board of Trustees, Office of the President, Office of the Provost, and Office of the General Counsel. The seal variation without the university motto, "Reach for the Stars," should be used when the seal is printed at a very small size, making the motto unreadable.

    <h4>Unofficial UCF Unit Graphics</h4>
    Unit graphics are NOT official UCF trademarks. UCF strongly discourages units from develop­ing these separate identifying graphics (logos), which are outside of official unit identifiers. Competing graphics dilute the impact of a singular UCF brand. These graphics CANNOT:
    <ul>
        <li>include the Pegasus</li>
        <li>be more prominent in size or position than the Pegasus, wordmark, monogram, university or unit identifiers</li>
        <li>appear on any single-page, printed piece or the front cover of any multipage printed piece</li>
        <li>appear in any print ad or employment ad</li>
        <li>appear in the header of the home page of a website</li>
        <li>appear on signage, including banners</li>
        <li>appear on UCF official business cards, letterhead, envelopes, name badges, fax cover sheets, or memo pads</li>
        <li>appear on the first or last slide of an electronic slide presentation, or on the first or last frame of a video
            or other multimedia presentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Use of UCF Trademarks by Outside Parties</h3>
    UCF requires that its marks be used in a manner that is consistent with the goals of the university and the university’s legal responsibilities as a trademark owner, and that UCF is properly compensated for the use of university marks in conjunction with authorized use of the marks. All items produced using the trademarks of the university and for resale are subject to the royalty payment requirements as set forth in approved licensing agreements. Only with prior written approval by the appropriate UCF department may UCF trademarks be used to promote events with UCF partners with an official relationship with the university. Outside parties may only use UCF trademarks if prior written approval has been obtained from UCF Marketing, UCF’s General Counsel’s Office, UCF Athletics and/or UCF Business Services, as appropriate.
    <h3>UCF Merchandise</h3>
    Permission to produce or sell clothing or other merchandise that incorporates UCF’s name, trademark(s) or logo(s) must be secured in advance in writing from each of the following departments:
    <ul>
        <li>University trademarks: Business Services</li>
        <li>Athletics trademarks: Business Services and UCF Athletics</li>
    </ul>
    UCF retains all rights to all articles of clothing and other merchandise that represent or promote the university or a unit of the university. Only UCF- approved vendors can produce or sell such merchandise. (Contact Business Services for the current list of approved merchandise vendors.) Individuals and companies producing or selling UCF clothing or merchandise without permission are subject to prosecution.

    <h4>Freelancers and Vendors</h4>
    It is the responsibility of each authorized UCF employee contracting with printers, designers, graphic artists, photographers, merchandisers and web designers to inform them of the university’s Graphic Standards and to make certain that the standards are applied to the materials being produced.

The header bar is a link to the UCF home page.

It also contains quick links to the most visited sections in the main site (such as the Libraries, Admissions and Financial Aid), myUCF and a Search bar.

It’s easy to install the header on your site. Visit <a title="University Header" href="http://universityheader.ucf.edu" target="_blank">universityheader.ucf.edu</a> to get the code or use the code below:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;!-- ADD UCF HEADER --&gt;

&lt;!-- END UCF HEADER --&gt;</pre>
The header should not be modified or changed in any way and websites should reference the files located at <a title="University Header" href="http://universityheader.ucf.edu" target="_blank">universityheader.ucf.edu.</a>
